A game in which you work collaboratively or competitvely to layer AR art over the real world. 



All the world's a stage...or it could be. AR gives us the opportunity to add a layer of shared fantasy to the physical world we already have.

This is a proof of concept game for one room, intended to be run on a Microsoft Hololens.

In AnnexNation, you get to wield magic. Take control of an element - fire, water, or nature. Claim a space in the room - surface, wall, floor, or midair. Layer illusion over the mundane - create waterfalls, vines, volcanoes. Then let the next player make their mark...and see what happens when your worlds collide. Struggle for dominance, or make art together.
